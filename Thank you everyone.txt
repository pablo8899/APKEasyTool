After 6 years, it has to be sadly announced that the project has been discontinued due to the changes my personal life, and lost the movitation to continue this project. I don't have the opportunity to get back to working on this anymore

Due to what happens with Android (Split APK/Android App Bundle, APK protections, Play Protect, system restrictions...) I decided to finish my Android journey right here. It was a nice experience, but not anymore.

The source code and assets are provided under download links. The project is based on C#, use Visual Studio 2019 or above to use it. Please feel free to continue developing with it, wish you good luck

Bitbucket server will be shut down at the end of 2022 (Jan 1 2023 00:00), users who use older version will no longer recieve update notification. Bitbucket became horrible service anyways, so there is no point keeping it up anymore
